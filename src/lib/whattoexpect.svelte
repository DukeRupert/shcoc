						At the South Hills Church of Christ, the Sunday morning worship time will be focused on
						singing, prayer, taking part in the Lord's Supper and a Bible focused, relevant
						Gospel-oriented sermon. You will feel welcomed by a warm group of people who have a
						heart for community. We offer children's and youth programs for your family as well.
					</p>

					<p>
						What we believe: Primarily we believe that God created the world, that his Son Jesus
						Christ came to earth, lived among us, died on a cross and was buried but on the third
						day rose again. Through his resurrection, death has been conquered and we can now
						experience eternal life through Jesus. Later Jesus ascended to Heaven and the Holy
						Spirit was given to believers as a counselor and down-payment.
