            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The story of South Hills Church of Christ began in 2011 when three Helena congregations - 
              the Rocky Mountain Church of Christ (125 members), the Helena Church of Christ (50 members), 
              and the Big Sky Church of Christ (25 members) - made the courageous decision to unite as one body.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              This unification wasn't just about combining numbers; it represented a deeper commitment to 
              putting aside differences and coming together for a greater purpose. The process began 
              naturally, with joint activities like Vacation Bible School and youth mission trips to 
              Mexico, which helped build relationships between families and youth groups.
